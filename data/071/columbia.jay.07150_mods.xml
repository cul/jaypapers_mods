   <mods:abstract>Desires to aid his country and has established a secret correspondence in
            England to learn of the sailing and destination of their fleets. When he lived in
            England he formed societies in the major cities in which the government measures and the
            American revolution were freely discussed. The nobility as well as the people attended
            in great numbers, and finally the government ordered his arrest as a traitor employed by
            Congress. "Taking advantage of the impression made by the late riots in their favor and
            I believe secretly encouraged for the purpose of throwing an odieur on the measures of
            opposition and the spirit of association, an order of the privy council was issued to
            apprehend me as the Cataline of the conspiracy and the secret agent of Dr. Franklin to
            burn the city London." Concerning the origin of the riots, the trial of Lord George
            Gordon will throw light on the subject. It probably is another game of Lord Bute's to
            overthrow opposition, and that nobleman Gordon? was in on the secret. Many signed the
            Protestant Association because of fear of the indulgences given to the Catholics. Others
            signed as a matter of policy because they felt the pro-Papist acts and the Quebec Bill
            were designed to strengthen the court party. "Unless the system of affairs is speedily
            changed the whole of the business may be considered as the harbinger of another
            revolution." The people have begun suddenly to see the decay of trade and manufactures,
            the restitution of honors and offices, the loss of public liberty resulting from the
            increasing influence of the crown, and the impending national bankruptcy. The Bedford
            faction has joined the opposition. The most opulent families and popular Whigs,
            imitating the American example, have formed committees. A congress of deputies meets
            "under the very nose of parliament" and publishes anti-government resolutions. This
            prominent opposition, plus the democratic ascendency of the armed associations and the
            declarations of the Northern maritime powers, has alarmed the government. Suggestions
            for American success over England. Most important is to try to intercept her trade and
            capture her seamen. A secret correspondence ought to be established with friends in
            England. The opportunity for direct invasion has been lost. It might have been
            successful last summer, but now it would only arouse their martial spirit and unite all
            contending parties. However, a blow might be struck by expeditions from the Spanish
            ports before any intelligence of the plan could arrive in England.</mods:abstract>
