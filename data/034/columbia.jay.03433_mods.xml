   <mods:abstract>Detailed explanation of relations with Spain, concerning both mission and
            monetary embarrassments. Money problems relieved temporarily in October by Franklin,
            hoped Spain would give some as well. The court promised someone to negotiate with Jay.
            Left hanging by Spanish court. Reply from minister was complaint about Commodore Gillon
            of Frigate South Carolina at Corunna, whose ship was held in port. Correspondence with
            Colonel Searles, who had confidential papers from Mr. Adams in Holland. Believed that
            the Spanish minister could not regularize situation of American prizes or commerce
            without recognizing its independence, thus caught in a bind. Description of Captain Hill
            incident with the Cicero at Bilboa; believes he received unfair treatment from the
            Spanish. By November money problems again; no answer from Floridablanca or Franklin.
            Very frustrated with Del CampoÆs lack of instructions and prevarication. Believed
            Spanish would have been impressed with American successes in Virginia and capitulation
            at Yorktown, but not so. Neither answer to Mr. HarrisonÆs note, nor reward money for
            Dover cutter given to its captors. Del CampoÆs constant illness. Met with French
            ambassador, who could not loan money as France preparing to send "great armaments"
            around the world. Because US not recognized, holders of bills could take action against
            Jay if bills protested. Observations on conduct of Spain as encouraging enemies,
            planting doubt among friends and lessening US desire to ally with Spain. France
            recommended caution and hope for Dutch loan. Letter from Franklin dissipated hope of
            aid; deterioration of monetary situation by early February. Silence of Floridablanca and
            increasing worry of Mr. Cabarrus about his money. Cabarrus offer to loan money for bills
            if Spain and France would guarantee loan. Begged French ambassador to speak to Spanish
            minister. Met Mr. Del Campo hoping to get money from Spain as so much already given by
            France. Mentioned Cabarrus offer and that Spain indebted to United States for recovery
            of West Florida and possession of Minorca. Cabarrus conference with Floridablanca about
            loan; king dissatisfied with American return of his good offices, in ships or flour, and
            still waiting to hear about building men of war in New England. Sees this as pretext of
            king to delay and not advance money. Met with French ambassador who would write again to
            Count de Vergennes but not hopeful about finding money for new bills. Sum only 20,000
            pounds, surprised AmericaÆs friends would let them lose credit over such a small amount.
            Spoke well of Marquis de Lafayette. Discussed situation in Holland, that Britain sent
            over Mr. Wentworth to negotiate separate peace. Told French that believed England most
            likely to recognize independence and that France did not want United States treated as
            independent, because would make United States less manageable. No reaction from French
            ambassador. Tried again with Floridablanca and Del Campo. Finally met with the minister,
            as bills due very soon. Spain would pay balance of $150,000 and no more but would meet
            with Cabarrus. Promised the French ambassador that promised talks (about the United
            States) would begin soon at Aranjuez. Assurance to Congress that Mr. Gardoqui would be
            sent to United States but delayed for variety of reasons. However, when Jay sent
            Cabarrus to the minister on March 11, informed that Jay had misunderstood and that
            Cabarrus should not be sent until the last extremity. Sends excerpt from the Madrid
            Gazette of an expedition of Spanish and Indians led by Eugenio Pierre against the
            British. Captured Post of St. Joseph, dispersed ammunition to Indians and claimed
            Illinois River for the Spanish. Goes back to business about bills coming due March 14,
            obtaining of delays on payment, and the change in Mr. CabarrusÆ offer. After much back
            and forth with the French ambassador, the Chevalier de Bourgoigne, Mr. Del Campo and
            Floridablanca, forced to protest the bills. Both French and Spanish courts blamed for
            not helping United States for such a trifling sum. Told French ambassador that this
            might save us the Mississippi. Suspects Spain and France discussed United States; told
            by France that Spain wished to mediate between United States and England and limit
            independence. News that Parliament advised British king to stop offensive had great
            effect on Spanish court. Credit reestablished from FranklinÆs letter; refused to
            reconcile with Cabarrus and now employ Messrs Drouilhet. Invitation from minister due to
            recent news, but thinks not in our interest to make peace with Spain now, worthwhile to
            wait until we are stronger militarily. Bad state of Spanish finances; Spain wants to
            continue war and get Gibraltar. France wants peace. Keep information Jay gets from
            French ambassador secret; De Marbois will fill in with great detail and information.
            Sweden leaning towards United States; Dutch will soon be our allies. In these
            circumstances, Spain should not expect Mississippi as price of acknowledgment. Courier
            de lÆEurope says English ministry have changed; unable to predict what changes will do.
            Serious attack on Gibraltar prepared, led by Duke de Crillon. Although Congress should
            be angry with Spanish court, should differentiate between the court and the people.
            Final matter concerns æmistakenÆ invitation to FloridablancaÆs dinner as a private
            gentleman, approved by Spanish king. Doubtful that was mistake but still could not
            accept. Same reason does not go to Court, because would be received as æStranger of
            DistinctionÆ rather than as minister from the United States.</mods:abstract>
