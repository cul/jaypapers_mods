   <mods:abstract>Provisional articles of treaty approved and ratified by Congress. Thinks
            can alleviate LivingstonÆs doubts about separate article (on Florida). British attempt
            to annex territory on eastern shore of Mississippi, to ensure extent of British
            territories worth keeping "as to afford a convenient retreat to the Tories." Americans
            thought that this area, West Florida up to the Yazoo river, too valuable in its land and
            position to give up. Also wanted to ensure British understood importance of navigation
            of Mississippi for their own commerce so they would not make an agreement with Spain
            ceding that right. However, increasing value of navigation also would increase value of
            land bordering the river, disinclining the British to then let go of that territory.
            Compromise reached that British would cede all right to territory about the Yazoo and
            the Americans below in the case that the British had the Floridas at the end of the war.
            Article thus quid pro quo rather than favor to the British. Decided to keep that article
            secret because in full swing of negotiations between Spain France and Britain. Would
            have upset Spain and involved the French. Americans not prohibited from making bargains
            with the British that do not concern other nations. Also Spain had other pretensions
            over that and other areas. Agrees that "honesty is the best policy" but sees no reason
            to think their negotiations were not as they should be. Believes LivingstonÆs sentiments
            motivated by sincerity but believes he does not have as complete an understanding of
            events as those who were involved in the actual negotiations. Does not want to hurt
            friendship with France; thinks the French minister acts with goodwill in so far as it
            corresponds to the promotion of French interests. Would never sacrifice "our Faith, our
            Gratitude or our Honor to any consideration of Convenience and may [God] also forbid
            that we should ever be unmindful of the Dignity and independent Spirit which should
            always characterize a free and generous People." Shall propose another article to
            postpone payment of British debts as Congress wishes. Admits to ambiguities in articles
            but should be seen in light of British desire to protect the Tories and ours to not
            absolutely favor them. The phrase "real British Subjects" clearly to not include
            American refugees. Sixth article about "no future confiscations" ought to have had fixed
            a time more definitely but sees it as determined by end of hostilities and not binding
            before. Evacuation of New York assured by Mr. Hartley; did not fix a time for it as
            perhaps British would have left it until after definitive treaty, to United StatesÆ
            disadvantage. Surprised at doubt in America over when hostilities ceased there, is one
            month after the date of its declaration in all parts of the world, land or sea, north of
            "latitude of the Canaries". Those ships in northern latitudes confiscated afterwards
            should be reclaimed, as well as "the transportation of Negroes from New York" [followed
            by first draft of letter to Robert Livingston]. LivingstonÆs doubts arise from belief
            that: negotiators were overly distrustful and suspicious, that agreement signed without
            prior knowledge of French court and that the separate article was not important but was
            offensive to Spain, in addition to being kept secret from both nations. Reminder that
            the American commissioners insisted on four things from the British a priori that the
            French minister believed premature or excessive: treatment of America as independent
            nation, agreement to boundaries claimed by the United States, fishing rights, and no
            definite reinstatement of Tories. Evident that the French did not have American best
            interest in mind, whatever the ministerÆs motive. Reason for not communicating articles
            to French before signing: Lord Shelbourne feared would have to resign if no speedy
            conclusion to war and saw negotiations as furthering this end. The British made
            concessions would not have otherwise made. Also, the King agreed to ratify only what Mr.
            Oswald should sign and seal, not a verbal agreement. French, if given articles, would
            have postponed signing of agreement until French, Spanish and British treaty could be
            signed as well. Delay giving opening for British to consider themselves not bound by
            present articles and allowing France to pressure British to not concede to our demands.
            Because signed in secret, avoided the necessity of offending the French by refusal to
            postpone signing. Was "no breach of our treaty with France." Although admits that they
            diverged from instructions of Congress, believes instructed to act for their own sake
            and not that of France. Confidence between allies already marred by French ministerÆs
            hiding of his articles, so should not be surprised if the Americans did the same.
            [FranklinÆs comments on part of letter that did not go out] May not be the best idea to
            attempt justification at present time, because matter is quiet in Europe, no letter sent
            to Congress ever a secret, charges of LivingstonÆs reaction to them would be seen as
            insult and denied. Situation still critical in Europe, should not be jeopardized.
            Censure not that of Congress but of private citizen. Laurens also is not there so cannot
            be part of justification. Save this part of letter for the future.</mods:abstract>
