   <mods:abstract>Has not neglected to write, but the news he had to communicate was not too
            important. Spirits in America were raised by the foreign assistance, but the inferiority
            at sea is unfortunate. American credit is lost in Europe. "It is almost as great a
            disgrace to be known as an American as it was two years since an honor." H. Laurens has
            been sent to obtain a loan, and Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia have also sent
            agents for the same purpose who bid against one another. More are expected to come.
            "John Adams went from France disgusted and left the Court and people equally so with
            him." The indecision of France is injurious to America. Lee and Izard undoubtedly will
            declare that the sending of forces is an insidious design to continue the war. P.S.
            Cannot see Jay because he must settle his accounts. Mentions the actions of Adams, Lee,
            and Izard concerning their accounts. The attitude toward Deane seems "in just" and "in
            grateful." Disastrous consequences of the depreciation--loss of credit in Europe. 20
            September: Thoughts on present situation of affairs. Reviews military operations and
            foreign aid up to this time. Is inclined to agree with the argument that France wants
            only to defeat England at the expense of America. They do not want to drive the British
            from the American continent, but they desire to send over partial supplies from time to
            time to keep the greater part of the British force occupied. Appearances favor this line
            of reasoning "and will go far to credit it in America where as in all nations the people
            resolve only from what they see." When the first application was made to the Court of
            France the people favored America, but the Ministers did not. Now the situation is
            reversed, but only one Minister favors America. Even though he has received only
            friendly treatment from the French, he fears that his apprehensions are correct. France
            can takeover the direction of affairs if England and the U.S. expend their power in this
            war. If peace is not accomplished soon, American affairs will be
            desperate.</mods:abstract>
