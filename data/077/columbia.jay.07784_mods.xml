   <mods:abstract>Apologizes for his complaining. Reviews the facts of his case. Deane did
            not know that he was accused of any fault other than not having settled his accounts.
            Repeats his accusation against Adams, Lee, etc. Their case is the same as his, but they
            were not accused. Deane is now saddled with the burden of all the unsettled accounts.
            Defends the measures he took. It is a proof of their friendship that Jay thinks that
            some of them were not prudent. Deane has full proof of the duplicity of friends in
            Congress. Those who appeared to support Deane against the Lee faction have declared that
            they desired to use Deane to destroy Lee's group. Even though Deane has found a large
            balance in his favor in the accounts, he doubts it will exonerate him. The bulk of the
            people mean well, but the men in public office are dishonest. Deane has collected
            materials to prove his innocence, but he doubts it can be published in America or in
            Europe, where American intrigues and cabals are regarded with contempt. Mr. Williams,
            who was implicated with Deane, had his accounts audited by the auditor of Congress, and
            he was shown to be perfectly innocent. However, Congress has, as yet, taken no notice.
            Congress gives little attention to being just to their servants. Jay has said that Spain
            wants the Mississippi. Deane thinks that Spain will not be of much help in the war. For
            them it will be all gain and no loss. England wants war and has the money. Congress must
            be much more energetic. H. Laurens stupidly allowed his packet to fall into English
            hands. Deane distrusts France. Secret negotiations exist in France as well as in
            Spain.</mods:abstract>
